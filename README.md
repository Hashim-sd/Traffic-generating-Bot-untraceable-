# Traffic-generating-Bot-untraceable-
This Python-based traffic generation bot simulates human-like behavior in browsing activities while targeting a specific website. The bot uses techniques such as random proxy selection, device fingerprinting spoofing, and human-like interaction patterns (mouse movements, scrolling, typing). The bot is also capable of handling proxy failures gracefully and can function with or without proxies.
